# Ally Front-End Development Coding Challenge

### Overview

In the UX Development Team here at Ally, we’re looking to hire developers who are technically skilled and passionate about the Web. To help us gain a better understanding of your strengths in these areas, we’d like for you to complete a coding challenge to get the conversation started. Look at this as your chance to put your best foot forward and give us your best shot!

The principles, concepts, and philosophies of development that we value most and that you need to take into account in your submission are:

*	Reusability
* Web Standards
*	Semantic Markup
*	Performance
*	Accessibility

### The Challenge

This repository contains a PSD including all page-states as well as [accompanying comps](https://github.com/allylabs/fed-coding-challenge/tree/public/assets/comps) to illustrate how the page should look upon completion. We've also included [assets from the PSD](https://github.com/allylabs/fed-coding-challenge/tree/public/assets/img) in case you don't have Photoshop.

Your challenge is to render this layout design as a fully functional web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your page should render perfectly in (at minimum) Chrome, Firefix and IE 9+.

### Technical Requirements

* Page should be approached from a component based mentality. Extra points will be given if the page is organized in a way some components may be reusable.
* Anchors on the page can just have “#” as their href.
* Only jQuery & vanilla javascript allowed (no plugins).
* No CSS libraries/frameworks may be used, however Babel and CSS (pre)processors like Sass are welcome for compiling your own CSS/ES6.
*	Rate table must be built-out and ordered correctly by consuming provided JSON file.
* Page should be responsive.
* Ensure that all code meets current a11y(Accessibility Standards)

### Submitting Your Completed Challenge

Reply to the sender of this challenge with a link to your Github repository containing your finalized assets. The deadline date/time for this challenge should have accompanied these instructions. If not, please respond to the sender of this challenge to inquire.

Good luck, give it your best, and we look forward to seeing your work!
